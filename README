PyHMM -- Simple HMM package in Python -- is a simple HMM package writed in
Python Programming Language. It implements the forward-backward algorithm
and Viterbi algorithm. It also provides some scripts to demonstrate how to
solve the three problems -- 'Problem 1', 'Problem 2' and 'Problem 3' ( which
are come from the book SLP*, more about the book, see notes bellow) -- in
HMM, these scripts are also writed in Python.

This pakcage is created just for learning purpose. If you want to do some
real jobs, you may want to implement the algorithms in C/C++ and call them
in Python.

The algorithms the package has implemented include:
    Forward           (problem 1 according to SLP*)
    ForwardWithScale  (scale method borrows from UMDHMM* package)
    Backward
    BackwardWithScale (scale method borrows from UMDHMM* package)
    Viterbi           (problem 2 according to SLP*)
    Baumwelch         (problem 3 according to SLP*, train an HMM model)
    RandomInitHMM
    ReadHMM           (file format borrows from UMDHMM* package)
    ReadSeq
    PrintHMM

It also has implemented some utility functions:
    lmap
    vector
    matrix
    matrix3
    getopt

File formats:
The file format is borrowed from the UMDHMM package, but *NOTE* that the
states and observations are encoded start from 0, *NOT* 1 interal, more about
this see the python docstring of module pyhmm( you can do it use command
"help(pyhmm)" after you import it).
